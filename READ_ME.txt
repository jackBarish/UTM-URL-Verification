This project was centered around the verification of URL’s and ensuring the UTM’s were properly encoded. The project allows users to Input URL’s that need verification though an excel file, and outputs a TXT file that provides insights to each URL that was analyzed in the program. The output allows the user to see the HTTP status code, page encoding, HTML page language, HTTP status and more. This project leverages BS4, webbrowser, and the requests library to help pull the needed information.
